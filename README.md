# FAO-Data-Cleaning-Pipeline
This notebook is designed to perform a comprehensive cleaning and transformation process on the FAOSTAT datasets after they have been downloaded. It will read the raw CSV files from the /kaggle/working/ directory, perform several cleaning steps, and save the resulting tidy data to a new Clean directory.
